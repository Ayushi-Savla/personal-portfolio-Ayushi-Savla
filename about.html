    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>A brief introduction about myself, my background, skills, and passions.</p>
    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Strathmore University. My academic journey has shaped my interest in using technology to solve real-world problems, particularly in the areas of sustainability, research, and social impact. I enjoy sharing my experiences with others in the same field to inspire and guide them as they grow.</p>
    <h2>My Technical Skills</h2>
    <p>Over time, I have gained practical experience in programming, web and mobile development, and system design. I am proficient in Python, Java, and C++, and I have also worked with IoT technologies in building sensor-based solutions such as a water quality monitoring system. Beyond coding, I have developed skills in event management, research collaboration, leadership, and mentoring, which help me bridge both technical and organizational aspects of projects.</p>
    <h2>My Interests and Goals</h2>
    <p>Outside academics, I am passionate about sports, design, and community engagement. I have played competitive tennis, serving as co-captain of the Strathmore University Tennis Team, and I also enjoy swimming and creative design work. My long-term career goal is to integrate technology with sustainable development projects, particularly in water governance and environmental conservation, to create solutions that positively impact both communities and ecosystems.</p>
